# Flappy-Ghost
It's a GUI game with the JavaFX library. It is inspired by the famous Flappy Bird. Here, the player embodies a ghost who walks in a level full of obstacles. There is no goal other than to advance as long as possible in the level without touching obstacles. The project was made with my colleague and friend, Justin Michaud.
